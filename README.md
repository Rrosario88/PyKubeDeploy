# PyKubeDeploy
Project that involves a web application developed with Python, hosted on a Linux Apache server, and incorporates Redis for caching. The infrastructure and deployment will involve Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins for CI/CD. Monitoring will be handled by Zabbix and ELK, and everything will be hosted on AWS

Great! Here's a step-by-step plan to create your project, PyFlaskKubeDeploy. The goal is to create a simple Python Flask application that uses Redis for caching, containerize it with Docker, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS, automate deployments with Jenkins and Ansible, and monitor it with Zabbix and the ELK stack.

Step 1: Develop your Python Flask application

Start by writing a Python web application using Flask that performs basic CRUD operations and uses Redis for caching. Test the application locally to ensure it works as expected.

Step 2: Dockerize the Application

Create a Dockerfile that defines a Docker image for your application. This Dockerfile will start with a base Linux image, install Python and Apache, copy over your application code, and install any necessary Python dependencies.

Step 3: Create Infrastructure With Terraform

Write a Terraform script that provisions an AWS EC2 instance, installs Docker and starts a Docker service. Test this script locally to make sure it works as expected.

Step 4: Deploy the Application With Ansible

Write an Ansible playbook that copies the Dockerfile to the EC2 instance, builds the Docker image, and runs a Docker container from that image. This playbook should also install and configure Zabbix for monitoring on the instance.

Step 5: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD

Install Jenkins on an AWS instance using Terraform and Ansible. Then, configure a Jenkins pipeline that fetches your application code from the source control, builds a Docker image, and deploys it to the EC2 instance whenever there's a code change.

Step 6: Set Up ELK for Logging

Use Terraform and Ansible to install and configure the ELK stack on an AWS instance. Configure your application to send logs to this ELK stack.

Step 7: Set Up Kubernetes

Provision a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Terraform. Update the Jenkins pipeline to deploy your application to this Kubernetes cluster instead of the standalone EC2 instance.

Throughout these steps, make sure to commit your code, Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, Terraform scripts, and Ansible playbooks to a Git repository, so you have version control for your project.
